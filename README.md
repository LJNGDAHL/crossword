# A simple crossword puzzle, built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## Development setup

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd crossword/
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`! ðŸš€

You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

## Deploy

To generate static files in the simplest way, write:

```sh
gatsby build
```

The static files are found in the public directory.

## Todo

- [ ] Open submit form once required fields are filled
- [ ] Post form data to i.e. Google Sheets
- [ ] Add CSS variables used for marking main, vertical row
